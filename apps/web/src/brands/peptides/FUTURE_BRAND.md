# PEPTIDES Brand Placeholder

This folder reserves space for future PEPTIDES brand.
Each brand will have completely unique frontend.
No shared UI components between brands.

## Brand Characteristics
- Medical/research interface
- Different from TOOLY's tools focus
- Will be implemented in future work orders

## Architecture Principle
Each brand gets its own:
- Components
- Sections
- Styles
- Layouts
- User experience

No UI code is shared between brands - only infrastructure (brand resolution, API clients, etc.)
